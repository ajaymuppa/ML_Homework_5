## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my work for **Home Assignment 5**, which includes:

* **Part A:** Written short-answer explanations on core ML/AI topics
* **Part B:** Coding implementations of Transformer components using NumPy and PyTorch

The goal of this assignment is to understand attention, positional encoding, multi-head attention, and ethical considerations in AI—along with practical hands-on coding.

* Role of softmax in normalization
* Context vector formation

### 🔹 Multi-Head Attention

* Benefits of having multiple attention heads
* Independent subspace projections
* Why concatenation + linear transformation is necessary

### 🔹 Ethics in AI

* Distinction between ethics, law, and personal feelings
* Utilitarian vs. deontological frameworks
* Why a single ethical standard for AI is difficult

### 🔹 AI Harms
